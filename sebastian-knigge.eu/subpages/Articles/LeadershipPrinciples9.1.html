		<h1><b>What ML models are used for smart ingredient procurement?</b></h1>
		
		<p><i>The 9th of Amazon's leadership principles is "Have a Bias for Action". Most (if not all) of the principles encourage staff to be proactive, 
			both from a technical and a strategic point of view. There are three tricks supporting you in decision making for AI solutions. "Reversibility 
			of Actions" is one of them.</i></p>

		<h2 ><b>Advise:</b></h2> 

		<p>
			There is no problem with erring on the side of action - many decisions and actions are reversible.
		</p>

		<h2><b>Explanation:</b></h2> 
		<p>
			Remembering that decisions are reversible helps you making decisions and encourages to execute. Newtons first law of motion 
			states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by an external 
			force. This applies to teams and organizations, too. If you keep barriers for decision making low, people will act, and the 
			team will stay in motion.  Moreover, an organization which keeps moving is also easier to maneuver than one which stands still.[1]
		</p>


		<h2><b>"There is an AI Solutions Architect in every employee"</b></h2> 

		<p>
			This advice comes in handy when it comes to the creation of use cases to apply ML to. In every employee there is a solutions 
			architect. The creativity in humans will produce an incredible number of use-cases for ML and AI. Once an organization educates 
			its employees on Machine Learning and put them into an inspiring environment, they will continuously come up with ideas for the 
			application of AI. But this force needs to be encouraged - for example with success stories. People who came up with ideas for 
			innovative AI use cases are encouraged to stay connected to the project and to participate from the success but aren't blamed 
			if the project is unsuccessful.<br>
			<br>
			I have been trusted with several internal projects within Crayon in which employees came up with innovative ideas of applying ML 
			to problems of their daily work. For those who don't know Crayons core business: Its core business is software licensing, licensing 
			optimization and cloud analytics.
		</p>

		<h2><b>"We ended up not using Machine Learning"</b></h2>
			
		<p>
			One use case that I have been asked to develop together with my small team was very promising and drew a lot of attention from management. 
			I worked on this project for half a year, conceptualizing, prototyping, and validating the approach. After all the work we invested in 
			the project, it turned out, the data was not available in the quality needed to generate the desired business value. We were able to address 
			the business problem with a different approach more effectively and ended up not using Machine Learning. During that time, I have learned 
			an insane amount about the underlying business and the subject matter expert we have been working with - who was the generator of the idea - 
			told me he did learn as much about ML and was inspired and hungry to come up with another idea of that sort to start the next project. The 
			team was not held accountable for the fact that we spent half a year working on a project that didn't result in a successful AI product. 
			It was just seen as an investment. But the project is remembered as one of the first AI projects in this field in the history of a successful 
			transformation of this industry. The next project – his colleague came up with the idea - was successful and ended up being one of my personal 
			flagship solutions. 
		</p>

		<h2><b>"The project generated a momentum"</b></h2>

		<p>
			Now please don't see this example as I would advise anyone to not evaluate projects carefully before starting implementation. In the example 
			given we had done a thorough assessment and our investment was backed by a waterproof business case. The project generated a momentum within 
			the organization and intrinsically motivated employees to come up with more use cases where AI could be a potential solution. This is where 
			I see the idea “Reversibility of Actions” could come in handy for strategic leaders in the space of AI and ML.
		</p>


		<h2><b>"Picking the right solution design"</b></h2> 

		<p>
			When you act as a Solution Architect, you are confronted with decision making on the design of a solution rather than strategic decisions how to 
			incentivize people. But the idea of "Reversibility of Actions" is also applicable on this level. Even if picking the right solution design and 
			defining specifics of the implementation is the most crucial part of a solutions architect, you want to be pragmatic. You can get stuck in a 
			loop of designing, considering and rejection of ideas. Keeping in mind that a specific implementation is modifiable helps you making the initial 
			decision and to start implementation. 
		</p>

		<h2><b>"I might have been confusing my team when hesitating to decide"</b></h2> 

		<p>
			Let me give another example: I was in the early stages of developing an ML solution in production for a client. This project was completely new 
			territory at the organization. Setting up solution requirements and discussing the pro and cons of design patterns did not give directions to 
			determine a single design. The requirements were so relaxed that a wide range of designs was suitable to achieve the client's desired goal. 
			I might have been confusing my team when hesitating to decide whether one or the other solution design would be the best, considering the 
			applications development in the future. Taking the trick of "Reversibility of Actions" into account, I decided to implement the initial architecture. 
			It was straight forward to implement and easy to explain. In case the day would come when it wouldn't make sense anymore, we would have to rethink 
			and adjust this part of the solution. But for now, we had a clear architecture to focus on.

				1. What is Well Architected Framework (WArF) and how to learn about it?
			</b>
		</h2> 

		<p>
			Microsoft introduced the Azure Well Architected Framework in a blog post in July 2020 
			(<a href=https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-microsoft-azure-wellarchitected-framework/>
			https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-microsoft-azure-wellarchitected-framework/</a>) 
			to "help you build and deliver great solutions" according to industry best-practices. However, one 
			could also view this as Microsoft's method to harmonize cloud solutions as much as possible or a way 
			to push Azure's native services. Be said, the framework is something not just solution architects 
			developing cloud solutions on Azure should know about, but also data engineers or data scientists may 
			want to take a look at.

		<h3>
			Material from Microsoft:
		</h3>
			
		<p>
			Besides all the people creating second level content about the Well Architected Framework (WArF), 
			there are essentially 3 sources of primary information to familiarize with the framework.<br>
			<ul>
				<li> 
					Nr. 1 is the 737 page-heavy <b>PDF documentation of Microsoft</b>, which can be downloaded. 
					Personally, I find it rather inconvenient and boring to go through 700 pages of concepts, 
					so I did not study it very deeply. </li>
				<li> 
					Nr. 2 is the Microsoft docs website (
					<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/">
						https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/
					</a>
					) with a bunch of videos, that make it more entertaining to digest the content. The navigation is 
					significantly more convenient, and the content can be displayed better in the browser. </li>
				<li>
					And Nr. 3 the <b>Well Architected Review</b> finally is a tool that is not primarily intended to inform, 
					but still helps to engage with the subject. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			<b>
				2. The 5 pillars of the Well Architected Framework
			</b>
		</h2>

		<h3>
			Mnemonic for WArF:
		</h3>

		<p>
			The guidelines and best practices are structured in 5 logical units called pillars. At first, the 5 items (Reliability, 
			Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance efficiency and Security) seemed like buzzwords in a list, 
			but as I became more familiar with them, I started delineating the points more clearly from each other. It helps 
			to build a mnemonic to remember the 5 pillars. When I think of the WArF, I think of robot cops, or <b>R-COPS</b>. After 
			reciting it a few times, you will never forget any of the 5 pillars.

				)

		</p>

		<h3>
			The five pillars of WArF:
		</h3>

		<p>
			The following is a very brief summary of the 5 pillars. If you are looking for detailed information 
			concerning the best practices, the Microsoft website is certainly the better place to go.

			<ol>
				<li>
					Reliability is about designing a solution that can recover from failures (disaster recovery) 
					and continue to function in case of a failure (resiliency). 
				</li>
				<li>
					Cost optimization ensures a high business value for the monthly cloud bill.
				</li>
				<li>
					Operational excellence is essentially all about DevOps and CI/CD - In machine 
					learning potentially MLOPs.
				</li>
				<li>
					Performance efficiency is about scaling the solution with the workload.
				</li>
				<li>
					And Security contains best practices to prevent from attacks and data leakage.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h3>
			Importance for Data Science and ML:
		</h3>

		<p>
			It helps to know the pillars by heart, and there is nothing wrong with taking a look at all best practices, 
			although I suspect not every pillar or concept within the WArF is equally important when it comes to data 
			science. <b>Security</b> and <b>cost optimization</b> should be addressed in every cloud architecture, no 
			matter if we are talking about a ML workload or a conventional user app with deterministic functionality. 
			<b>Operational excellence</b>, in professional machine learning solutions, must be considered in the design of such. DevOps is 
			an integral element of your production solution and MLOps an extension of it, addressing changing data and/or 
			performance of a model. As far as <b>reliability</b> and <b>performance efficiency</b> are concerned, requirements regarding 
			these features are to be agreed with the customer (internal or external) and the end users, respectively.

				3. Azure Well Architected Review
			</b>
		</h2>

		<h3>
			Well Architected Review:
		</h3>

		<p>
			The Well Architected Review (WArR) is a tool to check the proper application of concepts from WArF. Microsoft provides with 
			the WArR a methodology to evaluate a solution architecture or a delivered solution against the 5 pillars of the WArF. I 
			suppose it is advisable to do the first review as soon as the solution is designed according to the customer's requirements 
			but is not yet implemented. This helps possibly introduce adjustments resulting from the evaluation of the WArR. 
		</p>

			</i>
		</p>

		<h3>
			Azure Advisor:
		</h3>

		<p>
			Besides WArR there is another tool called Azure Advisor, which is built in the Azure Platform and gives recommendations 
			after implementation. Recommendations can be aggregated across several subscriptions if you want to use subscriptions 
			to separate development and production environments for example. While the Well Architected Review can be used prior 
			to implementation, Azure Advisor is rather a post-deployment checklist.

		<h3>
			Best usage of WArR:
		</h3>

		<p>
			While the tool may seem self-explanatory at first glance, I want to share some of the lessons I've learned to get the greatest 
			benefit from using it. 

			<ul>
			<li>
				On <a href="docs.microsoft.com">docs.microsoft.com</a> you could potentially do the review without being logged in. However, I would recommend to login with 
				credentials you remember (potentially company email address) to save your status and view the review at a later point in the 
				browser. 
			</li>
			<li>
				When starting the review, you are asked to name it. I would recommend coming up with a speaking naming convention, considering the start date 
				as you might do the review again at a later point when things have changed (e.g., Partner: &lt;Partner Name &gt;| Customer: &lt;Customer Name &gt; | Use Case: 
				&lt;UC Name &gt; | Started: &lt;YYYY-MM-DD &gt;). 
			</li>
			<li>
				In the reviews second step select only the pillars that are relevant. In mixed settings, this will help to define in advance of implementation which parts 
				of the solution you oversee and which you don't. 
			</li>
			<li>
				When we are talking data science solutions choose the review type Azure Machine Learning (even if it is in preview currently). 
			</li>
			<li>
				While filling in the question make sure to reference to the answers in the optional comment section below each question. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Export the reviews results once done, to preserve it in your repository. The graphical user interface to review the results 
				however is more convenient in the browser. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The results section "Next steps" lists the most important results you should review first. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Lastly for each pillar evaluated in the review you will have individual recommendations you should review and report to your customer. 
			</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			<b>
				4. Comparison to Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)
			</b>
		</h2>

		<h3>
			Cloud Adoption Framwork:
		</h3>

		<p>
			Besides the Well Architected Framework, there is yet a second common framework within the Azure universe. One should not confuse the 
			WArF with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/resources/tools-templates">Cloud Adoption Framework 
			(CAF)</a>. At first glance, there is some overlap. While the CAF addresses the adoption of Azure Cloud for an enterprise as a whole, the 
			WArF is a framework that is relevant for each individual application or solution in the cloud. The CAF is slightly more fundamental, the 
			WArF is used repeatedly in the life cycle of a given application in the Azure cloud. Both frameworks can be used in parallel or consecutively, 
			but they are definitely not mutually exclusive rather they complement each other.

			<b>
				Other Cloud Providers Frameworks
			</b>
		</h2>
		
		<h3>
			AWS and Google frameworks:
		</h3>

		<p>
			Besides Microsoft, many other cloud providers have published frameworks that provide best practices 
			for implementing solutions on their cloud technology. Amazon in fact has a document which has the same name 
			(“<b>AWS Well-Architected Framework</b>”) and Google provides the “<b>Google Cloud-Architecture-Framework</b>”. 
			The pillars of these frameworks do not change in the case of AWS and in the case of Google there is one section 
			called "System Design" in addition to the five R-COPS pillars. The principles therefore are unlikely to differ 
			substantially, and as a developer or solution architect you should be familiar with the other frameworks relatively 
			quickly once you have mastered WArF for Azure.
